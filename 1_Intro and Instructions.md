## What is webscraping?
Webscraping is the process of screening, extracting, and copying data from websites. In short, webscraping comprises all tools that allow developers to collect and analyze data from the Internet. 


## Why do we need webscraping?



## Tools for webscraping
There is a variety of different tool that can be used for webscraping. All of these tools have certain advantages and disadvantages as they are tailored for different use cases. In this course, we focus on the most prominent tools, but feel free to check out alternatives.

## Prerequisites of webscraping
Beyond being able to write python code and reading the documentation of webscraping libraries, you need to understand how a website is built. Only if you understand how the data you want to retriev is stored on the webpage you can automatically collect it with your scripts. To this end you should familiarize yourself with the basics of HTML, CSS, XML, and JavaScrpit. Further, the "inspect" function provided by Crometools can make your work dramatically easier. We will cover some of these basics during the course. But if you are interested in more details, you can have a look at the following sources:
